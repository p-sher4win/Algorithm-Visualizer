### Overview

The Algorithm Visualizer is a Python application built with Tkinter that allows users to visually observe and understand how various sorting algorithms work. It provides an interactive interface where users can select different algorithms, input custom data, and control the visualization speed, making it an excellent educational tool for learning and teaching sorting techniques.

### Features

- Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Visualize popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and more.
- Interactive Controls: Users can control the speed of the visualization, pause, and resume the sorting process.
- Custom Input: Users can input custom arrays to see how the algorithms handle different data sets.
- Real-Time Visualization: Watch the algorithms in action as they sort the data step-by-step.
- Educational Tool: Great for learning and teaching the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

### Technologies

- Python 3.9.13
- Tkinter: The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

### Run Locally

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p-sher4win/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
```

Run the visualizer:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Usage

1. Select an Algorithm:
- Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu and press the 'ENTER' button.

2. Input Data:
- To enter random array press 'RANDOM ARRAY' button or to input user defined array press 'INPUT DATA' button.

3. Control the Visualization:
- Use the 'START', 'PAUSE', and 'PREVIOUS' buttons to control the sorting process. Adjust the speed to 'slow', 'normal' and 'fast' to change the visualization speed.
